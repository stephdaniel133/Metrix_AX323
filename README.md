# Metrix AX323
This power supply can output between 0 V and 30.5 V at a current of 2.5 A. Both voltage and current are adjustable. The voltage has two potentiometers, one coarse and one fine, and the current has only one. There is also a 4,5 V to 5,5V at a current of 5 A. There is also an output adjustable between 4.5 V and 5.5 V at a non-adjustable current of 5 A.

I repaired this power supply after the LM324 on the first channel failed. To do this, I redrew the circuit diagram for the second channel.
I then drew this diagram in LTSPice to simulate it and understand how it works.

Below are some pictures of the power supply:
